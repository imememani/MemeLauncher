## MemeMans MemeLauncher
An advanced piece of software used to inject my custom built mod loader into GORNs main assembly. Also known as the **MemeLoader**. This tool is known as the **MemeLauncher** it's a mod manager and injection tool, it will also help mod creators mod GORN by providing a built-in project builder for Visual Studio, it will handle references and even create a bat file to move your assemblies on build.

## Backstory
This tool (excluding third party assets) was developed entirely solo for fun. My motivation behind it was the fact the developers would not add a feature to the game after an update to prevent enemies exploding, so I did it myself and the community followed! The Gorn Modding Discord was formed on the 8th of November 2018, 2 days after the loader released to the public. The server stands strong all this time later at a surprising **10,500+** member count!

## Source
If you're looking for sauce, the bottle is empty. My code is obfuscated and the license reserves any modification/distribution. This tool is one I'm proud of and like a magician, I ain't revealing my tricks. If you have a proposal I'm open for that, just DM me on Discord (.MemeMan#4489), as of right now I have no plans to release the source.
